.SH NAME
Mini-SEED record router: splitting, shuffling, organizing, etc.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
msrouter [options] [file1 file2 file3 ...]

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmsrouter\fP shuffles Mini-SEED records into user defined file and
directory layouts.  Input data records can either be read from one or
more files or read from standard input.  If no input files are
specified on the command line, records are read from standard input.

A file and directory layout, or archive format, is specified as a
string potentially including substitution flags.  For each input
record, any substitution flags in an archive format are replaced with
approriate values from the record (see the \fBArchive Format\fR
section below).  Some preset archive formats are defined: A simple
unique channel layout (CHAN), a simple unique channel-day layout
(CDAY), the Buffer of Uniform Data layout (BUD) and a common CSS
layout are defined.  More than one archive many be specified at once,
in which case every input record is written once to each archive.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-V         "
Print program version and exit.

.IP "-h         "
Print program usage and exit.

.IP "-H         "
Print program usage including substitution flag descriptions and exit.

.IP "-v         "
Be more verbose.  This flag can be used multiple times ("-v -v" or
"-vv") for more verbosity.

.IP "-Q \fIDRQ\fR"
Re-stamp all input Mini-SEED records with the specified record
indicator/quality flag before processing.  The value can only
be 'D', 'R' or 'Q'.  The indicator is changed regardless of what the
original was.

.IP "-D         "
Delete each input file after processing.  Each input file is deleted
regardless if there were errors reading the file.

.IP "-c         "
Split output files on continuous trace segments adding a suffix to any
trace segments after the first.

.IP "-B         "
Write uncompressed binary data samples to the output file(s) instead
of the Mini-SEED records.  Binary data is appended to output files in
the order it is read in.  Furthermore the -c option is recommended to
keep continuous time series separate.

.IP "-r \fIreclen\fP"
Specify the input record length in bytes.  By default the
record length of each input Mini-SEED record is automatically
detected, this option forces the record length.

.IP "-i \fItimeout\fR"
Timeout for closing idle data stream files in seconds.  The idle time
of data streams is only checked when a record is processed so if no
records are being processed no idle stream files will be closed.
There should be no reason to change this parameter except for unusual
cases where the process is running against an open file number limit.
This option is only really useful when the program is reading records
in a continuous fashion (probably from standard input) for long
periods of time; this will keep the program from unnecessarily holding
files open.  Default is 300 seconds.

.IP "-A \fIformat\fR"
All input records will be written to a directory/file layout defined
by \fIformat\fP.  All directories implied in the \fIformat\fP string
will be created if necessary.  The option may be used multiple times
to write input records to multiple archives.  See the \fBArchive
Format\fR section below.

.IP "-CHAN \fIdir\fR"
All input records will be written into a simple unique channel layout
where each channel is written to it's own file in the specified
\fIdir\fP.  This directory will be created if necessary.  This option
is a preset version of the '-A' option.  The CHAN dir/file layout is:
.nf
<dir>/NET.STA.LOC.CHAN
.fi

.IP "-CDAY \fIdir\fR"
All input records will be written into a simple unique channel-day
layout where each channel-day is written to it's own file in the
specified \fIdir\fP.  This directory will be created if necessary.
This option is a preset version of the '-A' option.  The CDAY dir/file
layout is:
.nf
<dir>/NET.STA.LOC.CHAN.YEAR:DAY:HOUR:MIN:SEC
.fi

.IP "-BUD \fIBUDdir\fR"
All input records will be written into a Buffer of Uniform Data (BUD)
dir/file layout starting at the specified directory.  This directory
and all subdirectories will be created if necessary.  This option is a
preset version of the '-A' option.  The BUD dir/file layout is:
.nf
<BUDdir>/<NET>/<STA>/STA.NET.LOC.CHAN.YEAR.DAY
.fi

.IP "-CSS \fICSSdir\fR"
All input records will be written into a CSS dir/file layout starting
at the specified directory.  This directory and all subdirectories
will be created if necessary.  The files are split on day boundaries,
the hour, minute and second values are those in the first record in
the file.  This option is a preset version of the '-A' option.  The
SDS dir/file layout is:
.nf
<CSSdir>/<YEAR>/<JDAY>/STA.CHAN.YEAR:JDAY:HOUR:MIN:SEC
.fi

.SH "Archive Format"
An archive format is expanded for each record using the following
substitution flags:

.nf
  \fBn\fP : network code, white space removed
  \fBs\fP : station code, white space removed
  \fBl\fP : location code, white space removed
  \fBc\fP : channel code, white space removed
  \fBY\fP : year, 4 digits
  \fBy\fP : year, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBj\fP : day of year, 3 digits zero padded
  \fBH\fP : hour, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBM\fP : minute, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBS\fP : second, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBF\fP : fractional seconds, 4 digits zero padded
  \fBq\fP : single character record quality indicator (D, R, Q)
  \fBL\fP : data record length in bytes
  \fBr\fP : sample rate (Hz) as a rounded integer
  \fBR\fP : sample rate (Hz) as a float with 6 digit precision
  \fB%\fP : the percent (%) character
  \fB#\fP : the number (#) character
.fi

The flags are prefaced with either the \fB%\fP or \fB#\fP modifier.
The \fB%\fP modifier indicates a defining flag while the \fB#\fP
indicates a non-defining flag.  All records with the same set of
defining flags will be written to the same file.  Non-defining flags
will be expanded using the values in the first record for the
resulting file name.

Time flags are based on the start time of the given record.

.SH EXAMPLES

The format string for the predefined \fIBUD\fP layout:

\fB/archive/%n/%s/%s.%n.%l.%c.%Y.%j\fP

would expand to day length files named something like:

\fB/archive/NL/HGN/HGN.NL..BHE.2003.055\fP

As an example of using non-defining flags the format string for the
predefined \fICSS\fP layout:

\fB/data/%Y/%j/%s.%c.%Y:%j:#H:#M:#S\fP

would expand to:

\fB/data/2003/055/HGN.BHE.2003:055:14:17:54\fP

resulting in day length files because the hour, minute and second are
specified with the non-defining modifier.  The hour, minute and second
fields are from the first record in the file.

.SH CAVEATS

If the -c option is used in combination with multiplexed input data
where the archive format does not separate the multiplexing
(e.g. input includes multiple channels from one or more stations but
the resulting archive is station files) the files will dutifully be
split when gaps in any of the included timeseries are detected, but
that won't make much sense if the output is still multiplexed.

If the program is running for long periods of time in a continuous
fashion, idle archive files will be closed.  If the archive format
includes non-defining flags (those starting with '#') and archive
files are close and later re-opened a new file will be created using
the non-defining flags in the filename just as the initial file was
created.  One work-around is to increase the idle timeout value so
that archive files are not closed before more data for those files are
received.
